<h2>Need for SDC<a class="headerlink" href="#need-for-sdc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A large part of the data collected by statistical agencies cannot be
published directly due to privacy and confidentiality concerns. These
concerns are both of legal and ethical nature. SDC seeks to treat and
alter the data so that the data can be published or released without
revealing the confidential information it contains, while, at the same
time, limit information loss due to the anonymization of the data. In
this guide, we discuss only disclosure control for
microdata. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#foot18" id="id1">1</a> Microdata are datasets that provide
information on a set of variables for each individual respondent.
Respondents can be natural persons, but also legal entities such as
companies.</p>
<p>The aim of anonymizing microdata is to transform the datasets to achieve
an “acceptable level” of disclosure risk. The level of acceptability of
disclosure risk and the need for anonymization are usually at the
discretion of the data producer and guided by legislation. These are
formulated in the dissemination policies and programs of the data
providers and based on considerations including “[…] the costs and
expertise involved; questions of data quality, potential misuse and
misunderstanding of data by users; legal and ethical matters; and
maintaining the trust and support of respondents” (<a class="reference internal" href="#dubo10">DuBo10</a>).
There is a moral, ethical and legal obligation for the data
producers to ensure that data provided by the respondents are used only
for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>In some cases, the dissemination of microdata is a legal obligation,
but, in most cases, the legislation will formulate restrictions. Thus, a
country’s legislative framework will shape its microdata dissemination
policy. It is crucial for data producers to “ensure there is a sound
legal and ethical base (as well as the technical and methodological
tools) for protecting confidentiality. This legal and ethical base
requires a balanced assessment between the public good of
confidentiality protection on the one hand, and the public benefits of
research on the other. A decision on whether or not to provide access
might depend on the merits of specific research proposals and the
credibility of the researcher, and there should be some allowance for
this in the legal arrangements.” (<a class="reference internal" href="#dubo10">DuBo10</a>).</p>
<p>“Data access arrangements should respect the legal rights and legitimate
interests of all stakeholders in the public research enterprise. Access
to, and use of, certain research data will necessarily be limited by
various types of legal requirements, which may include restrictions for
reasons of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>National security: data pertaining to intelligence, military
activities, or political decision making may be classified and
therefore subject to restricted access.</p></li>
<li><p>Privacy and confidentiality: data on human subjects and other
personal data are subject to restricted access under national laws
and policies to protect confidentiality and privacy. However,
anonymization or confidentiality procedures that ensure a
satisfactory level of confidentiality should be considered by
custodians of such data to preserve as much data utility as possible
for researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Trade secrets and intellectual property rights: data on, or from,
businesses or other parties that contain confidential information may
not be accessible for research. (…)” (<a class="reference internal" href="#dubo10">DuBo10</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Box 1, extracted from <a class="reference internal" href="#dubo10">DuBo10</a>, provides several

This includes both the use of disclosure limitation methods and the review process to ensure that the disclosure limitation techniques used provide adequate protection to the information.”</p></li>

<p>Besides the legal and ethical concerns and codes of conducts of agencies
producing statistics, SDC is important because it guarantees data
quality and response rates in future surveys. If respondents feel that
data producers are not protecting their privacy, they might not be
willing to participate in future surveys. “[…] one incident,
particularly if it receives strong media attention, could have a
significant impact on respondent cooperation and therefore on the
quality of official statistics” (<a class="reference internal" href="#dubo10">DuBo10</a>). At the same time, if data users
are unable to gain enough utility from the data due to excessive or
inappropriate SDC protection, or are unable to access the data, then the
large investment in producing the data will be lost.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-risk-utility-trade-off-in-the-sdc-process">
<h2>The risk-utility trade-off in the SDC process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-risk-utility-trade-off-in-the-sdc-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SDC is characterized by the trade-off between risk of disclosure and
utility of the data for end users. The risk–utility scale extends
between two extremes; (i) no data is released (zero risk of disclosure)
and thus users gain no utility from the data, to (ii) data is released
without any treatment, and thus with maximum risk of disclosure, but
also maximum utility to the user (i.e., no information loss). The goal
of a well-implemented SDC process is to find the optimal point where
utility for end users is maximized at an acceptable level of risk.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig21"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a> illustrates this trade-off. The triangle corresponds to the
raw data. The raw data have no information loss, but generally have a
disclosure risk higher than the acceptable level. The other extreme is
the square, which corresponds to no data release. In that case there is
no disclosure risk, but also no utility from the data for the users. The
points in-between correspond to different choices of SDC methods and/or
parameters for these methods applied to different variables. The SDC
process looks for the SDC methods and the parameters for those methods
and applies these in a way that reduces the risk sufficiently, while
minimizing the information loss.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig21"></span><img alt="_images/image1.png" src="_images/image1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 1 </span><span class="caption-text">Risk-utility trade-off</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>SDC cannot achieve total risk elimination, but can reduce the risk to an
acceptable level. Any application of SDC methods will suppress or alter
values in the data and as such decrease the utility (i.e., result in
information loss) when compared to the original data. A common thread
that will be emphasized throughout this guide will be that the process
of SDC should prioritize the goal of protecting respondents, while at
the same time keeping the data users in mind to limit information loss.
In general, the lower the disclosure risk, the higher the information
loss and the lower the data utility for end-users.</p>
<p>In practice, choosing SDC methods is partially trial and error: after
applying methods, disclosure risk and data utility are re-measured and
compared to the results of other choices of methods and parameters. If
the result is satisfactory, the data can be released. We will see that
often the first attempt will not be the optimal one. The risk may not be
sufficiently reduced or the information loss may be too high and the
process has to be repeated with different methods or parameters until a
satisfactory solution is found. Disclosure risk, data utility and
information loss in the SDC context and how to measure them are
discussed in subsequent chapters of this guide.</p>
<p>Again, it must be stressed that the level of SDC and methods applied
depend to a large extent on the entire data release framework. For
example, a key consideration is to whom and under what conditions the
data are to be released (see also the Section <a class="reference external" href="release_types.html">Release types</a>). If data are to be released
as public use data, then the level of SDC applied will necessarily need
to be higher than in the cases where data are released under license
conditions to trusted users after careful vetting. With careful
preparation, data may be released under both public and licensed
versions. We discuss how this might be achieved later in the guide.</p>
