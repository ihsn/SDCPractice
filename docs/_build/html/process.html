<h1>The SDC Process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-sdc-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section presents the SDC process in a step-by-step representation
and can be used as guidance for the actual SDC process. It should be
noted, however, that jumping between steps and returning to previous
steps is often required during the actual SDC process, as it is not
necessarily a linear step-by-step process. This guidance brings together
the different parts of the SDC process as discussed in the previous
sections and links to these sections. The case studies in the next
section follow these steps. This presentation is adapted from  <a class="reference internal" href="#hdfg12">HDFG12</a>.
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig81"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 21</span></a> at the end of this section presents the entire
process in a schematic way.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-need-for-confidentiality-protection">
<h2>Step 1: Need for confidentiality protection<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-need-for-confidentiality-protection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before starting the SDC process for a microdata set, the need for
confidentiality protection has to be determined. This is closely linked
to the interpretation of laws and regulations on this topic from the
country in which the data originates and thus country-specific. A first
step is to determine the statistical units in the dataset: if these are
individuals, households or legal entities, such as companies, a need for
disclosure control is likely. There are also examples of microdata for
which there is no need for disclosure control. Examples could be data
with climate and weather observations or data with houses as statistical
units. Even if the primary statistical units are not natural or legal
persons, however, the data can still contain confidential information on
natural or legal persons. For example, a dataset with houses as primary
statistical units can also contain information on the persons living in
these houses and their income or a dataset on hospitalizations can
include information about the hospitalized patients. In these cases,
there is likely still a need for confidentiality protection. One option
to solve this is to remove the information on the natural and legal
persons in the datasets for release.</p>
<p>One dataset can also contain more than one type of statistical unit. The
standard example here is a dataset containing both information on
individuals and households. Another example is data with employees in
enterprises. All types of statistical units present in the dataset have
to be considered for the need of SDC. This is especially important in
case the data has a hierarchical structure, such as individuals in
households or employees in enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, one has to evaluate whether the variables contained in the
dataset are confidential or sensitive. Which variables are sensitive or
confidential depends again on the applicable legislation and can differ
substantially from country to country. In case the dataset includes
sensitive or confidential variables, SDC is likely required. The set of
sensitive variables and confidential variables together with the
statistical units in the dataset determine the need for statistical
disclosure control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-data-preparation-and-exploring-data-characteristics">
<h2>Step 2: Data preparation and exploring data characteristics<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-data-preparation-and-exploring-data-characteristics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After assessing the need for statistical disclosure control, we should
prepare the data and, if there are multiple, combine and consider all
related data files. Then we explore the characteristics and structure in
the data, which are important for the users of the data. Compiling an
inventory of these characteristics is important for assessing the
utility of the data after anonymization and producing an anonymized
dataset, which is useful for end users.</p>
<p>The first step in data preparation is classifying the variables as
sensitive or non-sensitive, and removing direct identifiers such as full
names, passport numbers, addresses, phone numbers and GPS coordinates.
In case of survey data, an inspection of the survey questionnaire is
useful to classify the variables. Furthermore, it is necessary to select
the variables that contain relevant information for end users and should
be included in the dataset for release. At this point, it can also be
useful to remove variables other than direct identifiers from the
microdata set to be released. An example can be a variable with many
missing values, e.g., a variable recorded only for a select group of
individuals eligible for a particular survey module, and missing values
for the rest. Such variables can cause a high level of disclosure risk
while adding little information for end users. Examples are variables
relating to education (current grade), where a missing value indicates
that the individual is not currently in school, or variables relating to
childbirth, where a missing value indicates that the individual has not
delivered a child in the reference period. Missing values in themselves
can be disclosive, especially if they indicate that the variable is not
applicable. Often variables with the majority of values missing are
deleted at this stage already. Other variables that might be deleted at
this stage are those too sensitive to be anonymized and released or
those not important to data users and that could increase the risk of
disclosure.</p>
<p>Relationships may exist among variables in a dataset for a variety of
reasons. For instance, variables can be mutually exclusive in cases
where several binary variables are used for each category. An individual
not in the labor force will have a missing value for the sector in which
this person is employed (or more precisely not applicable).
Relationships may also exist if some variables are ratios, sums or other
mathematical functions of other variables. Examples are the variable
household size (as a count of individuals per household), or aggregate
expenditure (as a sum of all expenditure components). A certain value in
one variable may also reduce the number of possible or valid values for
another variable; for example, the age of an individual attending
primary education or the gender of an individual having delivered a
child. These relationships are important for two reasons: 1) they can be
used by intruders to reconstruct anonymized values. For example, if age
is suppressed but another variable indicates that they are in school,
then it is still possible to infer a likely age range for that
individual. Another example is if an individual is shown to be active in
Sector B of the economy. Even if the labor status of this individual is
suppressed, it can be inferred that this person is employed. 2) the
relationships in the original data should be maintained in the
anonymized dataset and inconsistencies should be avoided (e.g., SDC
methods should not create 58-year-old school boys, or married
3-year-olds), or the dataset will be invalid for analysis. Another
example is the case of expenditures per category, where it is important
that the sum of the categories adds up to the total. One way to
guarantee this is to anonymize the totals and then recalculate the
sub-categories according to the original shares of the anonymized
totals.</p>
<p>It is also useful at this stage to consolidate variables that provide
the same information where possible, so as reduce the number of
variables, reduce the likelihood of inconsistencies and minimize the
variables an intruder can use to reconstruct the data. This is
especially true if the microdata stems from an elaborate questionnaire
and each variable represents one (sub-) question leading to a dataset
with hundreds of variables. As an example, we take a survey with several
labor force variables indicating whether a person is in the labor force,
employed or unemployed, and if employed, in what sector. The data in
<a class="reference internal" href="#tab81"><span class="std std-numref">Table 26</span></a> illustrates this example. It is possible that each type of
sector has its own binary variable. In that case, this set of variables
can be summarized in two variables: one variable indicating whether a
person is in labor force and another indicating the employment status,
as well as the respective sector if a person is employed. These two
variables contain all information contained in the previous five
variables and make the anonymization process easier. If data users are
used to a certain release format where including all five variables has
been the norm, then it is possible to transform the variables back after
the anonymization process rather than complicating the anonymization
process by trying to treat more variables than is necessary. This
approach also guarantees that the relationships between the variables
are preserved (e.g., no individuals will be employed in several
sectors).</p>

<p>Besides relationships between variables, we also gather information
about the survey methodology, such as strata, sampling methods, survey
design and sample weights. This information is important in later
stages, when estimating the disclosure risk and choosing the SDC
methods. It is important to distinguish between a full census and a
sample. For a full census, it is common practice to publish only a
sample, as the risk of disclosure for a full sample is too high, given
that we know that everyone in the country or institution is in the data
(see also the Section
<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`Special case: census data &lt;anon_methods.html#Special case: census data`__</span></a>).
Strata and sample weights can disclose
information about the area or group to which an individual belongs
(e.g., the weights can be linked with the geographical area or specific
group in case of stratified sampling); this should be taken into account
in the SDC process and checked before release of the dataset.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-type-of-release">
<h2>Step 3: Type of release<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-type-of-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The type of release is an important factor for determining the required
level of anonymization as well as the requirements end users have for
the data (e.g., researchers need more detail than students for whom a
teaching file might be sufficient) and should be clarified before the
start of the anonymization process. Data release or dissemination by
statistical agencies and data producers is often guided by the
applicable law and dissemination strategies of the statistical agency,
which specify the type of data that should be disseminated as well as
the fashion.</p>
<p>Generally, there exist three types of data release methods for different
target groups (the Section
<a class="reference external" href="release_types.html">Release types</a>
provides more information on different release
types):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PUF: The data is directly available to anyone interested, e.g., on
the website of the statistical agency</p></li>
<li><p>SUF: The data is available to accredited researchers, who have to
file their research proposals beforehand and have to sign a contract;
this is also known as licensed file or microdata under contract</p></li>
<li><p>Available in a controlled research data center: only on-site access
to data on special computers; this is also known as data enclave</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are other data access possibilities besides these, such as
teaching files or files for other specific purposes. Obviously, the
required level of protection depends on the type of release: a PUF file
must be protected to a greater extent than a SUF file, which in turn has
to be protected more than a file which is available only in an on-site
facility, since the options the intruder can use the data are limited in
the latter case.</p>
<p>Besides the applicable legislation, the choice of the type of release
depends on the type of the data and the content.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Not every microdata set is suitable for release in any release type, even after SDC.</p>
</div>
<p>Some data cannot be protected sufficiently – it might always
contain information that is too sensitive to be published as SUF or PUF.
In such cases, the data can be released in on-site facilities, or the
number of variables can be reduced by removing problematic variables.</p>
<p>Generally, the release of two or more anonymized datasets, e.g.,
tailored for different end users from the same original, is problematic
because it can lead to disclosure if the two were later obtained and
merged by the same user. The information contained in one dataset that
is not contained in the other can lead to unintended disclosure. An
exception is the simultaneous release and anonymization of a microdata
set as PUF and SUF files. In this case, the PUF file is constructed from
the SUF file by further anonymization. In that way, all information in
the PUF file is also contained in the SUF file and the PUF file does not
provide any additional information for users that have access to the SUF
file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The anonymization process is an iterative process where steps
can be revisited, whereas the publication of an anonymized dataset is a
one-shot process.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the anonymized data is published, it is not
possible to revoke and publish another dataset of the same microdata
file. This would in fact mean publishing more than one anonymized file
from the same microdata set, since some users might have saved the
previous file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-intruder-scenarios-and-choice-of-key-variables">
<h2>Step 4: Intruder scenarios and choice of key variables<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-intruder-scenarios-and-choice-of-key-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After determining the release type of the data, the possibilities of how
an individual in the microdata could (realistically) be identified by an
intruder under that release type should be examined. For PUF and SUF
release the focus is on the use of external datasets from various
source. These possibilities are described in disclosure or intruder
scenarios, which specify what data an intruder could possibly have
access to and how this auxiliary data can be used for identity
disclosure. This leads to the specification of quasi-identifiers, which
are a set of variables that are available both in the dataset to be
released and in auxiliary datasets and need protection.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If the number of quasi-identifiers is high, it is recommended to reduce the set
of quasi-identifiers by removing some variables from the dataset for
release.</p>
</div>
<p>This is especially true for PUF releases. Disclosure
scenarios can also help define the required level of anonymization.</p>
<p>Drafting disclosure scenarios requires the support of subject matter
specialists, assuming the subject specialist is not the same as the
person doing the anonymization. Auxiliary datasets may contain
information on the identity of the individuals and allow identity
disclosure. Examples of such auxiliary data files are population
registers and electoral rolls, as well as data collected by specialized
firms.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>External datasets can come from many sources (e.g., other
institutions, private companies) and it is sometimes difficult to make a
full list of external data sources.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, not all external data
sources are in the public domain. Nevertheless, proprietary data can be
used by the owner to re-identify individuals and should be taken into
account in the SDC process, even if the exact content is not known.
Also, the variables or datasets may not coincide perfectly (e.g.,
different definitions, more or less detailed variables, different survey
period). Nevertheless, they should be considered in the SDC process.</p>
<p>Disclosure scenarios include both identity and inferential disclosure.
The disclosure depends on the type of release, i.e., different data
users have different data available and may use the data in a different
way for re-identification. For example, a user in a research data center
cannot match with large external datasets as (s)he is not permitted to
take these into the data center. A user of a SUF is bound by an
agreement specifying the use of the data and consequences if the
agreement is breached (see the Section <a class="reference external" href="release_types.html">Release types</a>
). Furthermore, it should be
evaluated whether, in case of a sample, possible intruders have
knowledge as to which individuals are in the sample. This can be the
case if it is known which schools were visited by the survey team, for
example. A few examples of disclosure scenarios are (see the Section
<a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html#Disclosurescenarios">Disclosure scenarios</a> for
more information):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Matching: The intruder uses auxiliary data, e.g., data on region,
marital status and age from a population register, and matches them
to released microdata. Individuals from the two datasets that match
and are unique are successfully identified. This principle is used as
an assumption in several disclosure risk measures, such as
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity, individual and global risk, as described in
the Section <a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html">Measuring Risk</a>.
This scenario can apply to both PUFs and SUFs.</p></li>
<li><p>Spontaneous recognition: This scenario should be considered for SUF
files, but is especially important for data available in research
data centers where outliers are present in the data and data is often
not strongly anonymized. The researcher might (unintentionally)
recognize some individuals he knows (e.g., his colleagues, neighbors,
family members, public figures, famous persons or large companies),
while inspecting the data. This is especially true for rare
combinations of values, such as outliers or unlikely combinations.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-5-data-key-uses-and-selection-of-utility-measures">
<h2>Step 5: Data key uses and selection of utility measures<a class="headerlink" href="#step-5-data-key-uses-and-selection-of-utility-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this step, we analyze the main uses of the data by the end users of
the released microdata file. The data should be useful for the type of
statistical analysis for which the data was collected and for which it
is mostly used. The uses and requirements of data users will be
different for different release types. Contacting data users directly or
searching for scientific studies and papers that use similar data can be
useful when collecting this information and making this assessment.
Alternatively, this information can be collected from research proposals
by researchers when applying for microdata access (SUF) or user groups
can be set up. Furthermore, it is important to understand what level of
precision the data users need and what types of categories are used. For
instance, in the case of global recoding of age in years, one could
recode age in groups of 10 years, e.g., 0 – 9, 10 – 19, 20 – 29, … Many
indicators relating to the labor market use categories that span the
range 15 – 65, however. Therefore, constructing categories that coincide
with the categories used for the indicators keeps the data much more
useful while at the same time reducing the risk of disclosure in a
similar way. This knowledge is important for the selection of useful
utility measures, which in turn are used for selecting appropriate SDC
methods.</p>
<p>The uses of the data depend on the release type, too. Researchers using
SUF files require a higher level of detail in the data than PUF users.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Anonymization will always lead to information loss and a PUF
file will have reduced utility. If certain users require a high level of
detail, release types other than PUF should be considered, such as SUF
or release through a research data center.</p>
</div>
<p>In the case of SUFs, it is
easier to find the main uses of the data since access is documented. One
way to obtain information on the use of PUF files is to ask for a short
description of intended use of the data before supplying the data. This
is, however, useful only if microdata has been released previously.</p>
<p>Statistics computed from the anonymized and released microdata file
should produce analytical results that agree or almost agree with
previously published statistics from the original data. If, for
instance, a previously published primary school enrollment rate was
computed from these data and published, the released anonymized dataset
should produce a very similar result to the officially published result.
At the very least, the result should fall within the confidence region
of the published result. It might be the case that not all published
statistics can be generated from the published data. If this is the
case, a choice should be made on which indicators and statistics to
focus, and inform the users as to which ones have been selected and why.</p>
<p>As discussed in the Section
<a class="reference external" href="utility.html">Measuring Utility and Information Loss</a>,
it is necessary to compute general utility
measures that compare the raw and anonymized data, taking into
consideration the end user’s need for their analysis. In some cases the
utility measures can give contradicting results, for example, a certain
SDC method might lead to lower information loss for labor force figures
but greater information loss for ratios relating to education. In such
cases, the data uses might need to be ranked in order of importance and
it should be clearly documented for the user that the prioritization of
certain metrics over others means that certain metrics are no longer
valid. This may be necessary, as it is not possible to release multiple
files for different users. This problem occurs especially in
multi-purpose studies. For more details on utility measures, refer to
the Section <a class="reference external" href="utility.html">Measuring Utility and Information Loss</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition-note-on-steps-6-to-10 admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Note on Steps 6 to 10</p>
<p>The following Steps 6 through 10 should be repeated if the data has
quasi-identifiers that are on different hierarchical levels, e.g.,
individual and household. In that case, variables on the higher
hierarchical level should be anonymized first, and then merged with the
lower-level untreated variables. Subsequently, the merged dataset should
be anonymized. This approach guarantees consistency in the treated data.
If we neglect this procedure, the values of variables measured on the
higher hierarchical level could be treated differently for observations
of the same unit. For instance, the variable “region” is the same for
all household members. If the value ‘rural’ would be suppressed for two
members but not for the remaining three, this would lead to unintended
disclosure; with the household ID the variable region would be easy to
reconstruct for the two suppressed values. The Sections
<a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html#Householdrisk">Household risk</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="sdcMicro.html#Householdstructure">Household structure</a> provide
more details on how to deal with data with household structure in <em>R</em>
and <em>sdcMicro</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-6-assessing-disclosure-risk">
<h2>Step 6: Assessing disclosure risk<a class="headerlink" href="#step-6-assessing-disclosure-risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to evaluate the disclosure risk of the raw data. Here
it is important to distinguish between sample data and census data. In
the case of census data, it is possible to directly calculate the risk
measures when assuming that the dataset covers the entire population. If
working with a sample, or a sample of the census (which is the more
common case when releasing sample data), we can use the models discussed
in the Section <a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html">Measuring Risk</a>
to estimate the risk in the population. The main inputs for
the risk measurement are the set of quasi-identifiers determined from
the disclosure scenarios in Step 4 and the thresholds for risk
calculations (e.g., the level of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity or the threshold
for which an individual is considered at risk). If the data has a
hierarchical structure (e.g., a household structure), the risk should be
measured taking into account this structure as described the Section
<a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html#Householdrisk">Household risk</a>.</p>
<p>The different risk measures described in the Section
<a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html">Measuring Risk</a> each have advantages
and disadvantages. Generally, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity, individual
risk and global risk are used to produce an idea of the disclosure risk.
These values can initially be very high but can often very easily be
reduced after some simple but appropriate recoding (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#step-8-choice-and-application-of-sdc-methods">Step 8: Choice and application of SDC methods</a>). The
thresholds shall be determined according to the release type. Always
remember, though, that when using a sample, the risk measures based on
the models presented in the literature offer a worst-case risk scenario
and might therefore be an exaggeration of the real risks for some cases
(see the Section <a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html#Individualrisk">Individual risk</a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="step-7-assessing-utility-measures">
<h2>Step 7: Assessing utility measures<a class="headerlink" href="#step-7-assessing-utility-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To quantify the information loss due to the anonymization, we first
compute the utility measures selected in Step 6 using the raw data. This
creates a base for comparison of results obtained when using the
anonymized data – i.e., in Step 10.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If the raw data is a sample,
the utility measures are an estimate with a variance and therefore it is
useful to construct confidence intervals in addition to the point

<div class="section" id="step-8-choice-and-application-of-sdc-methods">
<h2>Step 8: Choice and application of SDC methods<a class="headerlink" href="#step-8-choice-and-application-of-sdc-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The choice of SDC methods depends on the need for data protection (as
measured by the disclosure risk), the structure of the data and the type
of variables. The influence of different methods on the characteristics
of the data important for the users or the data utility should also be
taken into account when selecting the SDC methods. In practice, the
choice of SDC methods is partially a trial-and-error process: after
applying a chosen method, disclosure risk and data utility are measured
and compared to other choices of methods and parameters. The choice of
methods is bound by legislation on the one hand, and a trade-off between
utility and risk on the other.</p>
<p>The classification of methods as presented in <a class="reference internal" href="anon_methods.html#tab51"><span class="std std-numref">Table 6</span></a> gives a good
overview for choosing the appropriate methods. Methods should be chosen
according to the type of variable – continuous or categorical – the
requirements by the users and the type of release. The anonymization of
datasets with both continuous and categorical variables is discussed in
the Section <a class="reference external" href="measure_risk.html#Classificationofvariables">Classification of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In general for anonymization of categorical variables, it is useful to
restrict the number of suppressions by first applying global recoding
and/or removing variables from the microdata set. When the required
number of suppressions to achieve the required level of risk is
sufficiently low, the few individuals at risk can be treated by
suppression. These are generally outliers. It should be noted that
possibly not all variables can be released and some must be removed from
the dataset (see <a class="reference internal" href="#step-2-data-preparation-and-exploring-data-characteristics">Step 2: Data preparation and exploring data characteristics</a>
). Recoding and minimal use of suppression
ensures that already published figures from the raw data can be
reproduced sufficiently well from the anonymized data. If suppression is
applied without sufficient recoding, the number of suppressions can be
very high and the structure of the data can change significantly. This
is because suppression mainly affects combinations that are rare in the
data.</p>
<p>If the results of recoding and suppression do not achieve the required
result, especially in cases where the number of select quasi-identifiers
is high, an alternative is using perturbative methods. These can be used
without prior recoding of variables. These methods, however, preserve
data structure only partially. The preferred method depends on the
requirements of the users. We refer to the Section
<a class="reference external" href="anon_methods.html">Anonymization Methods</a> and especially the Section
<a class="reference external" href="anon_methods.html#Perturbativemethods">Perturbative methods</a>
for a discussion of perturbative methods implemented in <em>sdcMicro</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice of SDC methods depends on the data used since the
same methods produce different results on different datasets. Therefore,
the comparison of results with respect to risk and utility
(Steps 9 and 10) is key to the choice made. Most methods are implemented in the
<em>sdcMicro</em> package. Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to use
custom-made solutions. A few examples are presented in the Section
<a class="reference external" href="anon_methods.html">Anonymization Methods</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-9-re-measure-risk">
<h2>Step 9: Re-measure risk<a class="headerlink" href="#step-9-re-measure-risk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this step, we re-evaluate the disclosure risk with the risk measures
chosen under Step 6 after applying SDC methods. Besides these risk
measures, it is also important to look at individuals with high risk
and/or special characteristics, combinations of values or outliers in
the data. If the risk is not at an acceptable level, Steps 6 to 10
should be repeated with different methods and/or parameters.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Risk measures based on frequency counts
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity, individual risk, global risk and
household risk) cannot be used after applying perturbative methods since
their risk estimates are not valid.</p>
</div>
<p>These methods are based on
introducing uncertainty into the dataset and not on increasing the
frequencies of keys in the data and will hence overestimate the risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-10-re-measure-utility">
<h2>Step 10: Re-measure utility<a class="headerlink" href="#step-10-re-measure-utility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this step, we re-measure the utility measures from Step 7 and compare
these with the results from the raw data. Also, it is useful here to
construct confidence intervals around the point estimates and compare
these confidence intervals. The importance of the absolute value of a
deviation can only be interpreted knowing the variance of the estimate.
Besides these specific utility measures, general utility measures, as
discussed in the Section
<a class="reference external" href="utility.html">Measuring Utility and Information Loss</a>
, should be evaluated. This is especially
important if perturbative methods have been applied. If the data does
not meet the user requirements and deviations are too large, repeat
Steps 6 to 10 with different methods and/or different parameters.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Anonymization will always lead to at least some information loss.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-11-audit-and-reporting">
<h2>Step 11: Audit and Reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#step-11-audit-and-reporting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After anonymization, it is important to check whether all relationships
in the data as identified in Step 2, such as variables that are sums of
other variables or ratios, are preserved. Also, any unusual values
caused by the anonymization should be detected. Examples of such
anomalies are negative income or a pupil in the twentieth grade of
school. This can happen after applying perturbative SDC methods.
Furthermore, it is necessary to check whether previously published
indicators from the raw data are reproducible from the data to be
released. If this is not the case, data users might question the
credibility of the anonymized dataset.</p>
<p>An important step in the SDC process is reporting, both internal and
external. Internal reporting contains the exact description of
anonymization methods used, parameters but also the risk measures before
and after anonymization. This allows replication of the anonymized
dataset and is important for supervisory authorities/bodies to ensure
the anonymization process is sufficient to guarantee anonymity according
to the applicable legislation.</p>
<p>External reporting informs the user that the data has been anonymized,
provides information for valid analysis on the data and explains the
limitations to the data as a result of the anonymization. A brief
description of the methods used can be included. The release of
anonymized microdata should be accompanied by the usual metadata of the
survey (survey weight, strata, survey methodology) as well as
information on the anonymization methods that allow researchers to do
valid analysis (e.g., amount of noise added, transition matrix for
PRAM).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Care should be taken that this information cannot be used
for re-identification (e.g., no release of random seed for PRAM).</p>
</div>
<p>The metadata must be updated to comply with the anonymized data. Variable
descriptions or value labels might have changed as a result of the
anonymization process. In addition, the information loss due to the
anonymization process should be explained in detail to the users to make
them aware of the limits to the validity of the data and their analyses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-12-data-release">
<h2>Step 12: Data release<a class="headerlink" href="#step-12-data-release" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The last step in the SDC process is the actual release of the anonymized
data. This step depends on the type of release chosen in Step 3. Changes
to the variables made under Step 2, such a merging variables, can be
undone to generate a dataset useful for users.</p>
