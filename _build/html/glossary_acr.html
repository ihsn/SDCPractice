<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Administrative data</dt>
<dd>Data collected for administrative purposes by government agencies.  Typically, administrative data require specific SDC methods.</dd>
<dt>Anonymization</dt>
<dd>Use of techniques that convert confidential data into anonymized data/ removal or masking of identifying information from   datasets.</dd>
<dt>Attribute disclosure</dt>
<dd>Attribute disclosure occurs if an intruder is able to determine new characteristics of an individual  or organization based on the   information available in the   released data.</dd>
<dt>Categorical variable</dt>
<dd>A variable that takes values over a finite set, e.g., gender. Also  called factor in <em>R</em>.</dd>
<dt>Confidentiality</dt>
<dd>Data confidentiality is a property of data, usually resulting from legislative measures, which prevents it from  unauthorized   disclosure. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id1">[2]</a></dd>
<dt>Confidential data</dt>
<dd>Data that will allow   identification of an individual   or organization, either directly  or indirectly. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot1" id="id2">[1]</a></dd>
<dt>Continuous variable</dt>
<dd>A variable with which numerical   and arithmetic operations can be  performed, e.g., income.</dd>
<dt>Data protection</dt>
<dd>Data protection refers to the set of privacy-motivated laws, policies and procedures
that aim  to minimize intrusion into respondents’ privacy caused by the collection,
storage and dissemination of personal data.  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id3">[2]</a></dd>
<dt>Deterministic methods</dt>
<dd>Anonymization methods that follow a certain algorithm and produce
the same results if applied repeatedly to the same data with  the same set of parameters.</dd>
<dt>Direct identifier</dt>
<dd>A variable that reveals directly  and unambiguously the identity of a respondent,
e.g., names, social identity numbers.</dd>
<dt>Disclosure</dt>
<dd>Disclosure occurs when a person   or an organization recognizes or
learns something that they did not already know about another person
or organization through released data. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot1" id="id4">[1]</a>
See also Identity disclosure,  Attribute disclosure and  Inferential disclosure.</dd>
<dt>Disclosure risk</dt>
<dd>A disclosure risk occurs if an unacceptably narrow estimation of a respondent’s
confidential information is possible or if  exact disclosure is possible with a high level of
confidence. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id5">[2]</a>  Disclosure risk also refers to the probability that successful
disclosure could occur.</dd>
<dt>End user</dt>
<dd>The user of the released  microdata file after   anonymization. Who is the end
user depends on the release type.</dd>
<dt>Factor variable</dt>
<dd>Factor variables are one way to   classify categorical variables in <em>R</em>.</dd>
<dt>Hierarchical structure</dt>
<dd>Data is made up of collections of records that are interconnected   through links,
e.g., individuals  belonging to groups/households or employees belonging to companies.</dd>
<dt>Identifier</dt>
<dd>An identifier is a variable/   information that can be used to   establish identity
of an  individual or organization. Identifiers can lead to direct or indirect identification.</dd>
<dt>Identity disclosure</dt>
<dd>Identity disclosure occurs if an  intruder associates a known individual or organization with a released data record.</dd>
<dt>Indirect identification</dt>
<dd>Indirect identification occurs when the identity of an   individual or organization is
disclosed, not using direct identifiers but through a combination of unique
characteristics in key  variables. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot1" id="id6">[1]</a></dd>
<dt>Inferential disclosure</dt>
<dd>Inferential disclosure occurs if  an intruder is able to determine
the value of some characteristic  of an individual or organization
more accurately with the released data than otherwise would have been possible.</dd>
<dt>Information loss</dt>
<dd>Information loss refers to the reduction of the information
content in the released data   relative to the information content in the raw data.
Information loss is often measured with respect to common   analytical measures, such as
regressions and indicators. See also Utility.</dd>
<dt>Interval</dt>
<dd>A set of numbers between two   designated endpoints that may or  may not be included.
Brackets  (e.g., [0, 1]) denote a closed interval, which includes the   endpoints 0 and 1.
Parentheses (e.g., (0, 1) denote an open   interval, which does not include  the endpoints.</dd>
<dt>Intruder</dt>
<dd>A user who misuses released data  by trying to disclose information about an
individual or organization, using a set of   characteristics known to the   user.</dd>
<dt><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity</dt>
<dd>The risk measure  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>-anonymity is based on   the principle that the
number of  individuals in a sample sharing   the same combination of values (key)
of categorical key  variables should be higher than a specified  threshold <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>.</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>A combination or pattern of key   variables/quasi-identifiers.</dd>
<dt>Key variables</dt>
<dd>A set of variables that, in combination, can be linked to  external information to
re-identify respondents in the released dataset. Key variables   are also called
“quasi-identifiers” or “implicit  identifiers”.</dd>
<dt>Microaggregation</dt>
<dd>Anonymization method that is   based on replacing values for a   certain variable
with a common value for a group of records. The grouping of records is based on a
proximity measure of variables of interest. The groups of records   are also used
to calculate the replacement value.</dd>
<dt>Microdata</dt>
<dd>A set of records containing information on individual respondents or on  economic
entities. Such records   may contain responses to a survey questionnaire or
administrative   forms.</dd>
<dt>Noise addition</dt>
<dd>Anonymization method based on  adding or multiplying a   stochastic or randomized
number   to the original values to protect data from exact matching with
external files. Noise addition is typically applied to continuous   variables.</dd>
<dt>Non-perturbative methods</dt>
<dd>Anonymization methods that reduce the detail in the data or suppress certain
values (masking) without distorting the data structure.</dd>
<dt>Observation</dt>
<dd>A set of data derived from an  object/unit of experiment, e.g.,  an individual
(in  individual-level data), a household (in household-level  data) or a company
(in company data). Observations are also   called “records”.</dd>
<dt>Original data</dt>
<dd>The data before SDC/anonymization methods were applied. Also called “raw data”
or “untreated data”.</dd>
<dt>Outlier</dt>
<dd>An unusual value that is  correctly reported but is not  typical of the rest of the population.
Outliers can also be  observations with an unusual   combination of values for variables,
such as 20-year-old widow. On their own age, 20 and   widow are not unusual values, but their combination may  be. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot1" id="id7">[1]</a></dd>
<dt>Perturbative methods</dt>
<dd>Anonymization methods that alter  values slightly to limit  disclosure risk by creating uncertainty around the true values, while retaining as much   content and structure as  possible, e.g. microaggregation   and noise addition.</dd>
<dt>Population unique</dt>
<dd>The only record in the population with a particular set of  characteristics, such that the individual or organization can be distinguished from other units in the population based on that set  of characteristics.</dd>
<dt>Post Randomization Method (PRAM)</dt>
<dd>Anonymization method for  microdata in which the scores of  a categorical variable
are altered according to certain   probabilities. It is thus intentional misclassification
with known misclassification   probabilities. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot1" id="id8">[1]</a></dd>
<dt>Probabilistic methods</dt>
<dd>Anonymization methods that depend on a probability mechanism or a
random number-generating  mechanism. Every time a   probabilistic method is used, a
different outcome is generated.</dd>
<dt>Privacy</dt>
<dd>Privacy is a concept that applies to data subjects while confidentiality applies to data.
The concept is defined as   follows: “It is the status accorded to data which has been
agreed upon between the person or organization furnishing the data  and the organization
receiving it and which describes the degree of protection which will be  provided.” <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id9">[2]</a></dd>
<dt>Public Use File (PUF)</dt>
<dd>Type of release of microdata   file, which is freely available   to any user, for example on the   internet.</dd>
<dt>Quasi-identifiers</dt>
<dd>A set of variables that, in combination, can be linked to  external information to
re-identify respondents in the released dataset.  Quasi-identifiers are also called
“key variables” or “implicit   identifiers”.</dd>
<dt>Raw data</dt>
<dd>The data before SDC/anonymization methods were applied. Also called “original data”
or “untreated  data”.</dd>
<dt>Recoding</dt>
<dd>Anonymization method for  microdata in which groups of   existing categories/values
are replaced with new values, e.g. the values ‘protestant’, and   ‘catholic’ are replaced with
‘Christian’. Recoding reduces the detail in the data. Recoding of   continuous variables leads to a
transformation from continuous to categorical, e.g. creating income bands.</dd>
<dt>Record</dt>
<dd>A set of data derived from an  object/unit of experiment, e.g.,  an individual
(in  individual-level data), a household (in household-level  data) or a company (in company data). Records are also called “observations”.</dd>
<dt>Regression</dt>
<dd>A statistical process of  measuring the relation between the mean value of one variable and corresponding values of other variables.</dd>
<dt>Re-identification risk</dt>
<dd>See Disclosure risk</dd>
<dt>Release</dt>
<dd>Dissemination – the release to users of information obtained  through a statistical activity.   <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id10">[2]</a></dd>
<dt>Respondents</dt>
<dd>Individuals or units of   observation whose  information/responses to a survey make up the data file.</dd>
<dt>Sample unique</dt>
<dd>The only record in the sample  with a particular set of  characteristics, such that
the individual or organization can be distinguished from other units in the sample based on that set of   characteristics.</dd>
<dt>Scientific Use File (SUF)</dt>
<dd>Type of release of microdata   file, which is only available to  selected researchers
under contract. Also known as “licensed file”, “microdata under contract” or “research file”.</dd>
<dt><em>sdcMicro</em></dt>
<dd>An <em>R</em> based package authored by  Templ, M., Kowarik, A. and Meindl, B. with tools for
the  anonymization of microdata, i.e.  for the creation of public- and   scientific-use files.</dd>
<dt><em>sdcMicroGUI</em></dt>
<dd>A GUI for the <em>R</em> based   <em>sdcMicro</em> package, which allows  users to use the <em>sdcMicro</em>
tools without <em>R</em> knowledge.</dd>
<dt>Sensitive variables</dt>
<dd>Sensitive or confidential variables are those whose values  must not be discovered for
any respondent in the dataset. The determination of sensitive variables is often subject to  legal and ethical concerns.</dd>
<dt>Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC)</dt>
<dd>Statistical Disclosure Control techniques can be defined as the  set of methods to reduce
the risk of disclosing information on   individuals, businesses or other  organizations.
Such methods are   only related to the dissemination step and are usually based on  restricting the amount of or   modifying the data released. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot2" id="id11">[2]</a></dd>
<dt>Suppression</dt>
<dd>Data suppression involves not  releasing information that is  considered unsafe because it
fails confidentiality rules being applied. Sometimes this is done   is by replacing values
signifying individual attributes with missing values. In the context of this guide,
usually to achieve a  desired level of <em>k</em>- anonymity.</dd>
<dt>Threshold</dt>
<dd>An established level, value,   margin or point at which values   that fall above or
below it will  deem the data safe or unsafe. If  unsafe, further action will need
to be taken to reduce the risk of identification.</dd>
<dt>Utility</dt>
<dd>Data utility describes the value  of data as an analytical  resource, comprising analytical
completeness and analytical validity.</dd>
<dt>Untreated data</dt>
<dd>The data before SDC/anonymization methods were applied. Also called “raw data” or “original data”.</dd>
<dt>Variable</dt>
<dd>Any characteristic, number or  quantity that can be measured or  counted for each unit of  observation.</dd>
